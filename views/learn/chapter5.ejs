            <h1 >Triple Candlestick Patterns</h1>
            <p >Candlestick patterns are essential tools in technical analysis, offering insights into potential market movements by visually representing price action. Among these, <span id="purple">triple candlestick patterns</span> are particularly noteworthy for their ability to signal trend reversals or continuations with higher reliability. This guide delves into the most common triple candlestick patterns, their formations, and their implications for traders.</p>
            <p >The Triple Candlestick pattern, also known as the "Three Line Strike" or "Three Outside Up/Down," is a <span id="purple">candlestick chart pattern used in technical analysis to predict potential reversals</span> in the market. This pattern typically consists of three candlesticks and can be either bullish or bearish.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="morning">Morning Star</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">A morning star is a visual pattern consisting of three candlesticks that are interpreted as <span id="purple">bullish signs by technical analysts</span>. A morning star forms following a downward trend and it indicates the start of an upward climb. It is a sign of a reversal in the previous price trend. Traders watch for the formation of a morning star and then seek confirmation that a reversal is indeed occurring using additional indicators.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/morningstarcandlestickpattern.png" alt="morning star" id="morningStar">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">A morning star is a visual pattern, so there are no particular calculations to perform. <span id="purple">It is a three-candle pattern with the low point on the second candle</span>; however, the low point is only apparent after the close of the third candle.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">Morning star patterns can be used as a visual sign for the start of a trend reversal from bearish to bullish, but they become more important when other technical indicators back them up as previously mentioned. <span id="purple">Another important factor is the volume that is contributing to the pattern formation.</span></p>
    
            <h2 id="evening">Evening Star</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">An evening star is a stock price chart pattern that's used by technical analysts to detect when a trend is about to reverse. It's a <span id="purple">bearish candlestick pattern</span> that consists of three candles: a large white candlestick, a small-bodied candle, and a red candle.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/eveningStar.png" alt="eveningStar" id="eveningStar">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><span id="purple">Evening star patterns are associated with the top of a price uptrend</span>, signifying that the uptrend is nearing its end. The opposite of the evening star is the morning star pattern, which is viewed as a bullish indicator.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">A candlestick pattern is a way of presenting certain information about a stock. It represents the open, high, low, and close price for the stock over a period of time.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><span id="purple">Each candlestick consists of a candle and two wicks.</span> The length of the candle is a function of the range between the highest and lowest price during that trading day. A long candle indicates a large change in price and a short candle indicates a small change in price.</p>
    
            <h2 id="bullabnd">Bullish Abandoned Baby</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The bullish abandoned baby is a type of candlestick pattern that is used by traders to signal a reversal of a downtrend. <span id="purple">It forms in a downtrend and is composed of three price bars.</span> The first is a large down candle, followed by a doji candle that gaps below the first candle. The next candle opens higher than the doji and moves aggressively to the upside.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/bullAbandoned.jpeg" id="bullishAbadoned">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><span id="purple">The expectation is that the price will continue to move higher as the pattern shows that selling has been at least temporarily exhausted.</span> The bullish abandoned baby can be contrasted with a bearish abandoned baby pattern, which marks the possible end of an uptrend.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The psychology or idea behind the pattern is that the price has been dropping aggressively and just had a big sell-off again (first down candle). The price then forms a doji, which shows selling is leveling off as the open and close prices of the doji are nearly the same.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><span id="purple">Dojis are commonly associated with indecision.</span> In this case, the doji means that sellers may be losing momentum and buyers are starting to step in. The doji, or dojis, are followed by a strong advancing candle that typically gaps higher from the doji. This shows that buyers have regained control and that the selling has at least temporarily been exhausted.</p>
    
            <h2 id="bearabnd">Bearish Abandoned Baby</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">A bearish abandoned baby is a specialized candlestick pattern consisting of three candles, one with rising prices, a second with holding prices, and a third with falling prices. <span id="purple">Technical analysts expect that this pattern signals at least a short-term reversal in a currently upward trending price.</span> The occurrence of this pattern is quite rare appearing approximately 50 times over the past two decades on S&P 500 stocks. The signal is usually followed by bearish performance over the short term.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/bearishAbandoned.png" id="bearishAbandoned">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">A bearish abandoned baby can be a signal for a downward reversal trend in the price of a security. This pattern is formed when a doji-like candle is preceded by a gap between its lowest price and that of the previous candlestick. <span id="purple">The previous candlestick is a tall white candlestick with small shadows.</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The doji is also followed by a gap between its lowest price and the highest price of the next candle. <span id="purple">The next candlestick is a tall red candlestick with small shadows.</span> In this pattern, the doji candle becomes an important signal for traders and technical analysts seeking to identify a bearish reversal of a bullish trend.</p>
    
            <h2 id="white">Three White Soldiers</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">Three white soldiers is a bullish candlestick pattern that is used to predict the reversal of the current downtrend in a pricing chart. The pattern consists of <span id="purple">three consecutive long-bodied candlesticks that open within the previous candle's real body and a close that exceeds the previous candle's high.</span> These candlesticks should not have very long shadows and ideally open within the real body of the preceding candle in the pattern.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/threeWhite.jpg" id="WhiteSoldiers">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><span id="purple">The three white soldiers candlestick pattern is typically observed as a reversal indicator</span>, often appearing after a period of price decline. This chart pattern suggests a strong change in market sentiment in terms of the stock, commodity, or forex pair making up the price action on the chart.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">When a bullish candle closes with small or no shadows, it suggests that the bulls have managed to keep the price at the top of the range for the session. <span id="purple">Basically, the bulls take over the rally all session and closed near the high of the day for three consecutive sessions.</span> In addition, the pattern may be preceded by other candlestick patterns suggestive of a reversal, such as a doji or a hammer.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">When trading the three white soldiers pattern, it's important to note that the strong moves higher could create temporary overbought conditions. <span id="purple">The relative strength index (RSI), for example, may have moved above 70.0 levels.</span> In some cases, there is a short period of consolidation following the three white soldiers pattern, but the short- and intermediate-term bias remains bullish. The significant move higher could also reach key resistance levels where the stock could experience a period of consolidation before continuing to move higher.</p>
    
            <h2 id="crow">Three Black Crows</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">Three black crows are a visual pattern, meaning that there are no particular calculations to worry about when identifying this indicator. The <span id="purple">three black crows pattern occurs when bears overtake the bulls during three consecutive trading sessions.</span> The pattern shows on the pricing charts as three bearish long-bodied candlesticks with short or no shadows or wicks.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/threeCrow.jpg" id="threeCrow">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">In a typical appearance of three black crows, the bulls will start the session with the price opening modestly higher than the previous close, but the price is pushed lower throughout the session. <span id="purple">In the end, the price will close near the session low under pressure from the bears.</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The three black crows pattern should not be seen as a one-off signal but rather a pattern that occurs in a downtrend. <span id="purple">The appearance of three black crows is seen as a sign of the trend change to bearish as the previous uptrend shows signs of weakness.</span> The longer and more consistent the three black crows, the more reliable the signal.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The appearance of three black crows signals that the market trend may have shifted to bearish. Traders often watch for additional confirmation from other technical indicators, such as a moving average crossover or a downward trendline break.</p>
    
            <h2 id="bullstrike">Bullish Three-Line Strike</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The bullish three-line strike is a four-bar continuation pattern with mixed results when traded as intended.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/bullStrike.png" id="BullStrike">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The three-line strike name comes from the three white candles before the sizeable black reversal candle.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The following are the requirements for a valid bullish three-line strike pattern: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Three consecutive medium-to-large bullish candlesticks with higher closes, each opening within or near the previous candle’s real body with little to no upper shadow.</li>
                <li><span id="purple">The fourth bearish candlestick must open above the prior candle’s close and close below the first candle’s open.</span></li>
                <li>The three-line strike must occur during an uptrend.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">We see three bullish candles opening within or near the previous candle’s real body with almost no upper wicks. <span id="purple">The fourth bar opens higher than the last candle’s close, and the price falls considerably and closes below the first candle’s opening.</span></p>
    
            <h2 id="bearstrike">Bearish Three-Line Strike</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The bearish three-line strike candle pattern is a four-candle bearish continuation pattern. The basic premise is that the overriding trend, which in this case is bearish, will win out.</p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/bearStrike.jpg" id="BearStrike">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The following are the requirements for a valid bearish three-line strike pattern: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first three consecutive bearish candles should close lower than the previous candle.</li>
                <li>The first three candles should be similar in length, resembling a staircase.</li>
                <li>The bearish three-line strike must occur during a downtrend.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;"><span id="purple">The bearish three line strike is a bearish continuation candlestick pattern.</span> It comprises three bearish candles followed by a large bullish candle closing above the highest close of the previous three. The pattern signals a small pullback in a bearish trend, anticipated to be followed by a continuation of the downtrend1. To identify the pattern on a candlestick chart, traders should look for three consecutive bullish candles that are followed by a bearish candle that opens higher than the previous candle’s close but closes lower than the first candle’s open.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The traditional interpretation of a bearish three-line strike is that it signals a small pullback that will soon be followed by a continuation of the bearish trend.</p>
    
            <h2 id="inside">Three Inside Up/Down</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The terms "three inside up" and "three inside down" refer to a pair of candle reversal patterns (each containing three individual candles) that appear on candlestick charts. <span id="purple">The pattern requires three candles to form in a specific sequence, showing that the current trend has lost momentum and a move in the other direction might be starting.</span></p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/threeinsideup.webp" id="threeInside">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The three inside up pattern is a bullish reversal pattern composed of a large down candle, a smaller up candle contained within the prior candle, and then another up candle that closes above the close of the second candle.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The three inside down pattern is a bearish reversal pattern composed of a large up candle, a smaller down candle contained within the prior candle, and then another down candle that closes below the close of the second candle.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">These patterns are short-term in nature, and may not always result in a significant or even minor trend change.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">Consider using these patterns within the context of an overall trend. For example, use the three inside up during a pullback in an overall uptrend.</p>
    
            <h2 id="outside">Three Outside Up/Down</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The three outside up and three outside down are three-candle reversal patterns that appear on candlestick charts. <span id="purple">The pattern requires three candles to form in a specific sequence, showing that the current trend has lost momentum and might signal a reversal of an existing trend.</span></p>
    
            <img src="/images/learn-images/threeOutside.jpeg" id="threeOutside">
    
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">In particular, the pattern is formed when a bearish candlestick (one that closes lower than it opened) is followed by two instances of a bullish candlestick (which closes higher than it opens), or vice versa.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The first candle marks the beginning of the end of the prevailing trend as the second candle engulfs the first candle. <span id="purple">The third candle then marks an acceleration of the reversal.</span></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8rem;">The three outside up and three outside down patterns occur frequently and are reliable indicators of a reversal. Traders can use these indicators as primary buying or selling signals but still watch for confirmations from other chart patterns or technical indicators.</p>
